<!--
Definition and Usage

The :checked selector matches every checked <input> element 
(only for radio buttons and checkboxes) and <option> element.   

A "visited" link, i.e. one that gets picked up by the :visited pseudo-class, 
is one that is in the browser's history. 
So, the only way to turn those links back into non-visited links is to remove them from the browser's history.
