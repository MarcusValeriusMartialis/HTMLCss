 Column combinator (||)

The column combinator, which consists of two pipes (||) 
represents the relationship of a column element to a cell element belonging to the column it represents. 
Column membership is determined based on the semantics of the document language only: 
whether and how the elements are presented is not considered. 

If a cell element belongs to more than one column, 
it is represented by a selector indicating membership in any of those columns.
