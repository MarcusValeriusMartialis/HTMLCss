Definition and Usage

The :active selector is used to select and style the active link.

A link becomes active when you click on it.

Tip: The :active selector can be used on all elements, not only links.

Tip: Use the :link selector to style links to unvisited pages, 
the :visited selector to style links to visited pages, and 
the :hover selector to style links when you mouse over them.


The selector CSS :active, selects the element that is in an active state. 
The active state of an element begins at the moment when the user clicks the mouse button, 
and the moment the user releases the mouse click button.


Note: :active MUST come after :hover (if present) in the CSS definition in order to be effective!
