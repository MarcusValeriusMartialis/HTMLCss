Definition and Usage

An outline is a line that is drawn around elements, outside the borders, to make the element "stand out".

The outline property is a shorthand property for:

    outline-width
    outline-style (required)
    outline-color

If outline-color is omitted, the color applied will be the color of the text.

Note: Outlines differ from borders! 
Unlike border, the outline is drawn outside the element's border, and may overlap other content. 
Also, the outline is NOT a part of the element's dimensions; 
the element's total width and height is not affected by the width of the outline.

p {
  border: 2px solid black;
  outline: #4CAF50 solid 10px;
  margin: auto;  
  padding: 20px;
  text-align: center;
}
</style>
